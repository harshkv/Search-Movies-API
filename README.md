Developed a Movie Search Application using the Movie Database API. You can search any movie and display the search results. User can view the details of the selected movie. 

Performed JSON parsing to retrieve the movies, ListViews, or dynamic layout to display the list, a different activity to show the your favorite movies, and another activity to display the movie details.

The Application consists of three screens: Main screen, Favorite Movies screen, and Movie Details screen.
